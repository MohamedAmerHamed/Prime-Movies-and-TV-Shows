It looks like I don't have access to the content of the page you're viewing. However, based on the description of the dashboard, here are some questions that the dashboard might help answer:

How many titles are available on Prime Video?

What is the total number of ratings, genres, and directors?

What is the range of release years for the titles?

Which genres have the most titles?

How are the titles distributed by rating categories?

How many titles are available in each country?

What percentage of titles are TV shows versus movies?

How has the number of titles released each year changed over time?
